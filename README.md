# Capstone 1 Project Activiocity

This project is a fullstack review site dedicated to reviewing activities individuals can do while traveling different areas. The project with have a login function so that users can post reviews and comments to reviews when logged in. This feature will assist others in determining interest in activities throughout their travels.

For individuals not logged in they can review the activities and read reviews and comments.

The site will have administrator rights to ensure the continuity of the application.

The first tier MVP (Minimum Viable Product) will include:

AS A USER (NOT LOGGED IN), I SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
-Access the website via the Internet so I can browse activities and read reviews.
-View details for a specific reviewed activity

- User should be able to see the activities average score or rating.
  -User should be able to see any relevant information about the activity.
  -Search for specific activities, so user can see their scores and read reviews about them.
  -Sign up for an account so user can have a logged-in experience.
  -Log in to the site if user already has an account.

A LOGGED-IN USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
-Write and submit a review for an activity that includes:
A written text review
A score/rating
Only one review should be allowed per activity, per user
View a list of all reviews user has written.
Delete reviews user has written.
Edit reviews user has written.
Change the text review.
Modify the score/rating.
Write comments on reviews written by others.
View a list of all comments user has written.
Edit and delete users written comments.

AS AN ADMINISTRATOR, USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
-View a list of all reviewed activities.
-Add, edit, and remove reviewed activities.
Normal users should not have this ability.
Two REQUIRED pieces of information for each item:
Category or Tag:
For example:
Picture:
At least one picture representing the activity. This can be a link to a picture hosted either on your site or elsewhere on the Internet.
Administrators should be able to add and modify relevant information on an activity. It is up to developer to decide what information is relevant, necessary, or otherwise.
View a list of all users.
The administrator view for each user should include the users’:
Role (user or administrator)
Email address (should be unique)
Any other relevant information (name, review count, etc.)
AS AN ENGINEER, I SHOULD:
Have a well-seeded database so that I can simulate several different scenarios for the user stories below.
By doing this, you set yourselves up to tackle many of the points throughout the tiers. In the long run, this will potentially save you tons of time.
For example, seed hundreds of items and reviews with dummy data so that when you get to the “pagination” user story, you won’t have to worry about adding more.
Also, add a bunch of users with reviews so the review editing features can be worked on without already having the “write a review” functionality built.
Have secured user data so that no one can unrightfully manipulate information.
